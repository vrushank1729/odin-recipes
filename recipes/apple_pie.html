    <h1>Apple Pie</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An apple pie is a fruit pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apples. Apple pie is often served with whipped cream, ice cream ("apple pie à la mode"), custard or cheddar cheese.
    It is generally double-crusted, with pastry both above and below the filling; the upper crust may be solid or latticed (woven of crosswise strips). The bottom crust may be baked separately ("blind") to prevent it from getting soggy. Deep-dish apple pie often has a top crust only. Tarte Tatin is baked with the crust on top, but served with it on the bottom.</p>
    <p>Apple pie is an unofficial symbol of the United States and one of its signature comfort foods.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough for double-crust pie</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>6 to 7 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg white</li>
        <li>Optional: Turbinado or coarse sugar, ground cinnamon, vanilla bean ice cream and caramel sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°. On a lightly floured surface, roll half the dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle; transfer to a 9-in. pie plate. Chill while preparing filling. In a small bowl, combine sugars, flour and spices. In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice. Add sugar mixture; toss to coat. Add filling to crust; dot with butter.</li>
        <li>Roll remaining dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle. Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edge. Cut slits in top. Beat egg white until foamy; brush over crust. If desired, sprinkle with turbinado sugar and ground cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Bake on the lowest rack 60-70 minutes, until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, covering with foil halfway if crust begins to get too dark. Cool on a wire rack. If desired, serve with ice cream and caramel sauce.</li>
    </ol>

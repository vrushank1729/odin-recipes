    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Eggs Benedict is a common American breakfast or brunch dish, consisting of two halves of an English muffin, each topped with Canadian bacon,[1] a poached egg, and hollandaise sauce. It was popularized in New York City.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>150g butter, melted, cooled</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>125g shaved ham</li>
        <li>2 English muffins, cut in half</li>
        <li>Avocado, thinly sliced, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For hollandaise sauce, combine the vinegar and egg yolks in a food processor, very slowly adding the butter bit by bit. Add lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl, cover and leave to sit.</li>
        <li>To poach the eggs, fill a saucepan with water to two-thirds full. Add a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a medium-low heat. Stir the water until a whirlpool forms. Break the egg into a saucer, and then slide into the water. Cook, without stirring for 3-4 minutes, depending on desired consistency. Remove to a plate with a slotted spoon. Repeat with remaining eggs.</li>
        <li>Toast English muffins until golden brown. Top with ham, avocado and eggs. Drizzle with hollandaise sauce. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
